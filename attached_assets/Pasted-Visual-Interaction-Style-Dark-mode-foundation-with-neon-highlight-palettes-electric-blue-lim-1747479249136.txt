Visual & Interaction Style:

Dark‑mode foundation with neon highlight palettes (electric blue, lime green, hot pink).

Layered UI panels on home, map, and summary screens that shift perspective on tilt or scroll, emulating a 3D parallax effect.

Physics‑driven transitions: every screen change, popup, and button press follows a 0.2–0.3 s ease‑in‑out curve with subtle spring dynamics.

Micro‑interactions: gauge fills, icon morphs, and toggle ripples that convey weightlessness and responsiveness.

Inspiration from Leading Apps:

Strava – GPS tracking in airplane mode with queued uploads; segments and heatmap overlays for post‑ride insights Strava SupportSpingcyclehub.

Komoot – One‑tap “Store for offline use” for tours or full region maps; topo‑aware routing with voice guidance support.komoot.comReddit.

Map My Ride – Airplane‑mode capture of every metric plus real‑time audio coaching; community challenges stored locally .

Ride With GPS – Offline‑mode toggle, downloadable turn‑by‑turn cue‑sheets, and live logging for friends .

OsmAnd – Full OSM map downloads, bike‑optimized routing, voice guidance, and local GPX recording Wikipedia.

Organic Maps – Privacy‑first offline maps with contour lines, elevation profiles, and turn‑by‑turn cycling navigation Wikipedia.

Core Features & Workflow:

On‑device Data Capture: Real‑time logging of GPS, accelerometer, gyroscope, and cadence; store records in an encrypted SQLite or Realm database to survive force‑closes.

Automatic Ride Detection: Start/pause/end rides via motion‑sensor thresholds, with haptic feedback.

3D Analytics Dashboard: Interactive 3D charts for cadence, power, and elevation; heatmap overlays on the parallax map.

Offline Map Engine: Pre‑downloaded vector tiles and terrain data for flawless zoom, pan, and offline turn‑by‑turn cues.

AR Safety & Coaching: Optional HUD prompts for turn cues and hazard alerts via AR glasses or camera view.

Custom Home Widgets: Live speed/distance/time “gauge” widgets with animated fills and neon outlines.

Technical Considerations:

Sensor Fusion: Blend GPS, accelerometer, and gyroscope data for sub‑meter accuracy without network A‑GPS Strava Support.

Framework: Use Flutter or React Native with native modules for low‑level sensor access and GPU‑accelerated animations.

Local Storage: Optimized on‑device DB (SQLite/Realm) with offline‑first sync logic.

Animations & Transitions:

Screen and panel transitions follow a 0.2–0.3 s ease‑in‑out spring curve.

3D transform layers on map tiles and UI cards shift perspective dynamically with user input.

Buttons and toggles exhibit hover‑like press states (scale, glow) to reinforce depth.
