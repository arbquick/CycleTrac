Create a one‑of‑a‑kind bicycle tracking app that records GPS coordinates, speed, cadence, and elevation entirely on‑device—no network required—with optional cloud sync when you’re back online. Its sleek, futuristic interface features a dark‑mode foundation accented by neon electric blue, lime green, or hot pink, and layered UI panels that shift perspective on tilt or scroll to create a subtle 3D parallax effect across the home dashboard, map view, and ride summary. All transitions—from screen changes to pop‑up overlays—follow a 0.2–0.3 s ease‑in‑out curve with spring‑style physics, and micro‑interactions such as gauge fills, icon morphs, and toggle ripples convey weightlessness and responsiveness. Drawing inspiration from Strava’s airplane‑mode GPS recording with queued uploads and heatmap overlays, Komoot’s one‑tap “Store for offline use” of entire regions and turn‑by‑turn topo‑aware routing, Map My Ride’s seamless offline stat logging with real‑time audio coaching, Ride With GPS’s downloadable cue‑sheets and live logging features, and OsmAnd’s and Organic Maps’ full offline map downloads with bike‑optimized routing and privacy‑first design, this app fuses on‑device sensor fusion (GPS, accelerometer, gyroscope) for sub‑meter accuracy, an encrypted SQLite or Realm database to preserve data through force‑closes, and an offline‑first vector tile engine for smooth pan, zoom, and navigation cues. Automatic ride detection triggers start, pause, and end events via motion‑sensor thresholds, accompanied by haptic feedback, while a 3D analytics dashboard presents interactive cadence, power, and elevation charts with heatmap overlays on the parallax map. Optional AR safety and coaching HUD prompts appear in an AR glasses or camera view, and customizable home‑screen widgets display live speed, distance, and time with animated neon‑outlined gauges. Built in Flutter or React Native with native modules for GPU‑accelerated animations and low‑level sensor access, the app’s architecture diagram should map sensor data flows to local storage and optional cloud sync, and a Figma prototype should demonstrate the 3D parallax interactions, physics‑based animation flows, and offline ride detection in action.
